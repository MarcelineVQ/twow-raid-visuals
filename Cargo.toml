# The wow_cdbc and wow_mpq crates live in the wowemulationâ€‘dev/warcraft-rs repository.
# They provide parsing and writing support for World of Warcraft DBC files and
# creating MPQ archives respectively.  When building this crate yourself you
# should ensure that these dependencies are resolvable either via crates.io or
# by pointing the `git` URL at the appropriate revision.  The entries below
# assume that crates.io exposes these crates; if not you can replace them with
# a git dependency, e.g.:
# wow-cdbc = { git = "https://github.com/wowemulation-dev/warcraft-rs", package = "wow-cdbc" }
# wow-mpq  = { git = "https://github.com/wowemulation-dev/warcraft-rs", package = "wow-mpq" }
