#foo 8100 base

# Beause faerlina's model scales up during the fight and because gehennas and warlocks scales
# differ we need to use an AreaModel instead of the on-impact method that flamestrike uses.
# This does't get the nice fade-in speed improvement however.
# todo: improve this, knowing when RoF wil tick is CRITICAL to a raid.
# maybe just have a different marker for the start of it that fits any scale
